**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Simon Xie**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/light-soundgame)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used the stackoverflow website for help with math.random and arrays as well as w3schools for help with logic statements.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was learning the web development in general, specifically javascript which gave me a bit of a struggle. While the concepts of web development introduced were relatively easy, there were still some challenges that I did encounter. Overall, I made sure to first try to test out what some of the javascript functions did on a seperate file. I had a bit of a hard time trying to understand the code provided but I was able to understand through continuously following the guide for creating the website as well as checking the optional help tooltips. One specific example of this was the whole sound chunk of code, but after researching a bit on what each statement did, I was definitely able to understand. One specific issue I had was if else statements in javascript as I was sort of unfamiliar if they worked the exact same as in Java, so I overcame this solution by reading about it on w3schools whcih definitely helped me understand through giving me practice. Certain other issues such as .lit also confused me a bit, but after searching up what these statements did, I was definitely able to understand. Finally another challenge that made it hard for me was creating the javascript random array. I was unfamiliar with array instantiation as well as the methods within the class, so I had to look up the Arrays class on a javascript documentation website. I also learned how to generate the random numbers through math.random through stackoverflow, and I was surprised to realize that it was similar to how it is done in java. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this submission, I was definitely a lot more curious about web development than before as I found this project to be extremely fun. First of all, I was very curious about the roles and responsibilities that web developers are given in creating websites as well as updating websites. I am also very interested in the time frame of completing websites, such as how long a website usually takes to make. Another question I had about web development after doing a little research was the responsibilities of front end web developers and back end web developers. After taking a class that discussed program/website vulnerabilities, I am also curious in how these vulnerabilities are taken into account.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely introduce the optional feature of implementing faster playback. I thought that was a clever feature that I would have definitely liked to figure out. Learning how to introduce audio files and images into my website would also definitely be another feature I would like to have learned. I would definitely work on trying to spruce up the start and stop buttons, so they do not look so bland as well as learning how to make my random array update each time after a game, which i think would just require updating the existing array inside of a the stopgame function. I would have definitely also wanted to work on introducing lives into the game as I thought that was a relatively nice addition.]
